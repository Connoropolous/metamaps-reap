<div class="question">Who may use Metamaps.cc? <div class="switch minimizeAnswer"></div></div>
<p class="answer">You! We are currently in "beta" mode, meaning that the application is undergoing continuous testing and refinement. During this time, we welcome participants of all ages in this trial process with the understanding that things are evolving, and may hold a few surprises! Request an invite if you'd like to explore and build with us - feedback is always welcome.</p>

<div class="question">What does it take to learn to Metamap? <div class="switch"></div></div>
<p class="answer off">While the interface may not seem familiar at first, we've designed it to be both intuitive and empowering after a bit of practice. There are only a handful of basic functions, like adding topics and drawing "synapse" connections, that are needed get you going! A handy cheat sheet is available on the canvas for reference while mapping, and we have an online manual and tutorials to grasp more advanced functionality. Also check out our video tutorials to see it in action. But overall - the best way to learn is to start mapping, and to connect with other mappers in our online community.</p>

<div class="question">What is the platform being used for currently? <div class="switch"></div></div>
<p class="answer off">Firstly, check out our featured maps! At a basic level, metamaps are great for laying out complex ideas and scenarios. We're seeing maps of creative brainstorms, product design, personal research and learning, project management, and narrative storylines. Some users have been capturing live workshop event documentation, or organizing study groups. We're using it ourselves to organize collaboration and develop strategies for the project. We'd love to see what else you can come up with.</p>

<div class="question">Who made this up? Why? <div class="switch"></div></div>
<p class="answer off">The Metamaps.cc project was launched as an emergent collaboration between designer Gavin Keech, architect Ishan Shapiro, and web developer Connor Turland over the years 2010-12, with input and inspiration from many other peers and projects. Its design draws from the fields of computational cognition, collective intelligence, and human-computer interaction. We continue to design and develop optimal, novel ways to connect people and ideas through visual information. </p>

<div class="question">How is MM different from other "mind mapping" apps? <div class="switch"></div></div>
<p class="answer off">First and foremost, metamaps bring people together into a shared knowledge environment. Topics and maps "in the commons" invite collaborative editing and shared insight. As new content and connections are made throughout the system, all users benefit from collective intelligence. Other distinguishing factors on the platform include a focus on real-time collaboration, a flexible visual categorization system via metacode icons, no built-in structural biases, and an intuitive search tool to find content. As the project evolves, we will be building in powerful network and graph analysis techniques which ae not currently offered in other mind mapping apps.</p>
