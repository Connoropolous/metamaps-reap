<div class="question">Who may use IdeaWall? <div class="switch minimizeAnswer"></div></div>
<p class="answer">Anyone who receives an invite from REAP or the FELT lab. It is currently in "prototype" mode, meaning that the application is undergoing continuous testing and refinement. You can also request an invite from Metamaps.cc, the free and open source public platform very similar to IdeaWall. We welcome participants of all ages in this trial process with the understanding that things are evolving, and may hold a few surprises! Feedback is always welcome.</p>

<div class="question">What does it take to learn to use IdeaWall? <div class="switch"></div></div>
<p class="answer off">While the interface may not seem familiar at first, we've designed it to be both intuitive and empowering after a bit of practice. There are only a handful of basic functions, like adding topics and drawing "synapse" connections, that are needed get you going! A handy cheat sheet is available on the canvas for reference while mapping, and we have an online manual and tutorials to grasp more advanced functionality. Also check out our video tutorials to see it in action. But overall - the best way to learn is to start mapping!</p>

<div class="question">What is the platform being used for currently? <div class="switch"></div></div>
<p class="answer off">At a basic level, IdeaWall is great for laying out complex ideas and scenarios. You can use it to map creative brainstorms, product design, personal research and learning, project management, and narrative storylines. Some applications have been capturing live workshop event documentation, or organizing study groups. Our team is using it ourselves to organize collaboration and develop strategies for the project. We'd love to see what else you can come up with.</p>

<div class="question">Who made this up? Why? <div class="switch"></div></div>
<p class="answer off">IdeaWall is commissioned by Research Entrepreneurs Accelerating Prosperity, for use within the FELT Lab. It is built using an open source technology, Veqtor, created for the Metamaps.cc project. The Metamaps.cc project was launched as an emergent collaboration between designer Gavin Keech, architect Ishan Shapiro, and web developer Connor Turland over the years 2010-12, with input and inspiration from many other peers and projects. Its design draws from the fields of computational cognition, collective intelligence, and human-computer interaction. Veqtor, Metamaps.cc and IdeaWall are currently maintained by CultureCraft and the Metamaps Open Value Network.</p>

<div class="question">How is IdeaWall different from other "mind mapping" apps? <div class="switch"></div></div>
<p class="answer off">First and foremost, IdeaWall bring people together into a shared knowledge environment. Topics and maps "in the commons" invite collaborative editing and shared insight. As new content and connections are made throughout the system, all users benefit from collective intelligence. Other distinguishing factors on the platform include a focus on real-time collaboration, a flexible visual categorization system, few built-in structural biases, and an intuitive search tool to find content. As the project evolves, we will be building in powerful network and graph analysis techniques which are not currently offered in other mind mapping apps.</p>
